# The MQ5 sensor's filament senses the fire. The MQ5 Gas Sensor module is useful for gas leakage detection. It can detect LPG, i-butane, methane, alcohol, Hydrogen, smoke and so on.​

# Immediately after catching the fire, the output values range 800+ as opposed to very low values (in the range of 40s)  when there is no gas leak.​

# And then we used buzzer which sounds up when the MQ5 sensor catches the fire and alerts everyone to evacuate the area.
